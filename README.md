# FINAL-YEAR-PROJECT
EduGuru â€“ Bridging Students and Tutors Seamlessly
EduGuru is a web-based platform designed to connect students, parents, tutors, and tuition centers in a structured and reliable way. Inspired by my own challenges as both a tutor and student, this Final Year Project simplifies the process of finding or offering tutoring services based on subject, experience, rates, and location.

Key features include tutor profiles with qualifications, intro videos, and reviews for informed decision-making. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript (frontend) and Django + MySQL (backend), the project follows Agile methodology for iterative development and usability-focused enhancements.

EduGuru aims to replace outdated, referral-based methods with a smarter, centralized solution for private education matchmaking.
